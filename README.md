This is my polyglot programming dictionary consist of

  'term': a common software problem (e.g. change each value in an array)

  'definition': a common solution to the problem in a prticular language

I have several years of programming experience in ruby.

When I look at a problem to solve, I have a clear mental model that

how I can solve this problem using ruby.

However, when I work on other languages. I spend quite a bit of time searching

how to do things the way I do with ruby.

This is good way to learn new langauges and we sometimes find the better solution to that language.

However, as a professional developer, learning and coding at the same time

limit the productivity a lot.

The goal of this project is to solve a software problem in our head using 'terms'

so that one solution can be interpreted to many different languages using 'definition'

of each dictionary.
